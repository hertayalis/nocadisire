She is 55 years old.</strong></p><p><strong>The American is most known as a model and, among other things, as the ex-wife of drummer for Mötley Crüe, Tommy Lee. She lived in Hugh Heffner’s Playboy Penthouse while working as a Playboy model.</strong></p><p><strong>Their union was brief, and following their divorce, Elaine’s fame started to slowly fade away since she began devoting more of her time to her family and other essential aspects of her life.</strong></p><p><strong>After stepping away from the spotlight, she turned to teach, but she had to take a pause after suffering an accident in 2016.</strong></p><h2><span id=Is_Elaine_Starchuk_Married_Relationship>Is Elaine Starchuk Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>Starchuk wed Tommy Lee in <strong>1984</strong>, but the couple split up after just seven days for unexplained reasons and got divorced the following year. Despite her having four children, later on, they never had any children together.</p><p>A year after divorcing Starchuk, Tommy’s second romance was with Heather Locklear. After divorcing Locklear, Tommy Lee temporarily became engaged to model Bobbie Brown; however, they never wed.</p><p>Instead, Tommy started dating<strong> actress and model </strong>Pamela Anderson, with whom he had two children: son Brandon Thomas in 1996 and son Dylan in late 1997.</p><figure id=attachment_1434256 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1434256 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Elaine Starchuk" width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Elaine Starchuk With Her Ex-Husband (Source: Twitter)</strong></figure><p>They divorced in <strong>1998</strong> nonetheless, allegedly because Anderson was holding their younger kid when Lee allegedly kicked her.</p><p>Despite the fact that their relationship had ended because of it, Lee and Anderson briefly rekindled their romance after Tommy was released from prison after serving a six-month sentence. However, they split up once more in <strong>2001</strong>.</p><p>Although it was claimed that they were back together in <strong>2008</strong>, their relationship experienced further ups and downs before they finally called it quits in the following year.</p><p>A singer with German and Greek background named Sofia Toufa and Lee became engaged in <strong>2014</strong>; however, their engagement ended in 2017.</p><p>The most recent is that he wed social media personality, Brittany Furlan, in <strong>2019</strong>.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Lenny_Kravitz_Girlfriend_Gay_Children>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></h3><h2><span id=How_did_Elaine_Starchuk_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Elaine Starchuk start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Along with Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, and others, Lee was a founding member of the rock band Mötley Crüe.

The automobile was reportedly being driven by an elderly guy who lost control of it.</p><p>According to witnesses, the former model was forced against the deli wall, which crumbled around her. She was in pain, gasping for air, and thought her ribs were shattered.</p><p>Elaine Starchuk was taken to Royal Columbian Hospital, where she checked herself out despite having sore hands, arms, and neck.
