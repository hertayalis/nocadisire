What is the cause of the death of Rasheem Carter?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A federal probe into the case was requested on Monday by the family of a Mississippi man whose dismembered body was discovered in November and whose recently revealed autopsy report indicates he was killed.</p><p>Carter was last seen on October 2 at a motel in Laurel. On November 2, his rotting body was discovered near Taylorsville, some 21 miles away, in a rural region.</p>Ben Crump, a well-known civil rights lawyer, urged the Justice Department should take up the issue during a press conference on Monday with Carter’s family after the local police stated they had no grounds to suspect foul play in the man’s death. &nbsp; The Smith County Sheriff’s Department did not go into detail in a statement on social media about why they thought there was no foul play or what brought them to the wooded area where Carter’s remains were discovered. &nbsp; <strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Obituary: Kayla S Rowe Passed Away, Death Cause Age And Family</a><h2>Rasheem Carter Autopsy Photos – Cause Of Death</h2><p>The netizens want to know what exactly has happened to Rasheem Carter. As a result, they wonder about Rasheem Carter Autopsy Photos and reports.</p><p>Carter, a Black man, reportedly went to the Taylorsville Police Department the day before he vanished and reported that he feared for his safety because men were after him, which may be the cause of his death.</p><p>The young Black man Rasheem disappeared last year after informing his mother that unknown men were after him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Rahseem-Carter.png><p>The state Bureau of Investigation and local police provided false information about Carter’s ongoing investigation. The families of Carter think he was murdered brutally in cold blood.&nbsp;</p>Crump, the attorney, said Carter’s autopsy proved his head was separated from his body, and some of his body parts were located elsewhere. &nbsp; The civil rights attorney Ben Crump and the mother of late Crter revealed the photos of Carter from an independent autopsy where we can clearly see Rasheem’s head was separated from the rest of his body. &nbsp; Crump said the photos of the Rasheem Carter autopsy photos tell you there is nothing usual about this. He also said the family needs the highest enforcement levels to provide Rasheem Carter justice.<h2>rasheem carter age and case details revealed</h2><p>Carter was born in October 1996 and was raised in Fayette, Mississippi. Rasheem was twenty-five years which was slaughtered brutally, and his body was found in a rural region of Taylorsville in a wooded area.</p><p>Late Rasheem finished high school in 2015, and he used to play football and baseball. Later, he studied welding and cutting at a nearby community college.</p>The family and friends of Carter informed that he was charitable, outgoing, and focused on business motives. As per the sources, he also established a seafood business in the city of Fayette. &nbsp; <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Rasheem-Carter.png> The last address of Rasheem was in the city of Vicksburg, as per the heavily-redacted Mississippi Department of Public Safety report gained by VICE News. &nbsp; Carter had planned to expand his restaurant business there and in neighboring towns like Natchez, but the venture failed when food prices increased due to the pandemic. &nbsp; The young Carter was reported missing on October 2 after calling the police for assistance which was the last day Carter’s family heard from him. On November 2, the officers found his remains in a rural area of Mississippi, Taylorsville. &nbsp; <strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Mertcan Cakmak Missing Child Update, Where Was He Last Seen?
