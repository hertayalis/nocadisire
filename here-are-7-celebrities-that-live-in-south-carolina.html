Hollywood and its glamor, fostered by innumerable celebrity wealth videos, as well as the cult hit Kardashian-Jenner reality TV shows representing it as the hub of all things awesome, have people wondering whether there is any other place where the Industry’s well-known names would even consider settling in for good given the unmatched charm and allure of Hollywood.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>However, some of the Industry’s A-list names have detached from this norm and decided to venture into the South. It seems that the much-heard and talked about southern scenic beauty and hospitality has attracted the attention of many celebrities, and one state that has stood out amongst the rest is <a href=#>South Carolina</a>, which has recently seen a transition from being a vast stretch of natural beauty to a humble abode for a plethora of Hollywood’s renowned names.</p><h2 id=h-why-do-some-celebrities-live-in-south-carolina data-injectable=false>Why do some celebrities live in South Carolina?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/south-carolina.jpg><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Areas like Charleston, Bluffton, and Hilton Head Island can be considered L.A.’s equivalents due to the possibility of encountering numerous celebrities on the streets. Some were born there, explaining their attachment to their hometown, while others are simply mesmerized by every form of comfort, be it food, beaches, and way of living that the region has to offer.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>The tropical paradise of Hilton Head Island, Bluffton, and Beaufort is also a hot spot for celebrities looking for a vacation. With its pristine beaches, Southern comfort food, and warm hospitality, who wouldn’t want to stay here for a while? It has been shown that <a href=#>South Carolina</a>‘s natural beauty fosters a creative spirit, as well. It has become a homecoming destination for celebs born and raised in the Lowcountry or those who have a special attraction to its Southern charm. Here’s a list of 7 celebrities who have chosen to reside in South Carolina.</p><h2 id=h-1-darius-rucker data-injectable=false>1. <strong>Darius Rucker</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Darius-Rucker-1.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>The former lead singer of Hootie & the Blowfish has admittedly been intrigued with his hometown, Charleston, for quite a long time. He loves it to the degree of having made the decision to live there. He resides with his wife, Beth, and kids in a grand mansion in the city designed by Charleston-based interior designer Angie Hranowsky.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Their lavish house, which is quite intimidating in structure, captures many Southern values and features architectural styles such as a wide entry space, colorful interiors with a white background, and separate rooms for books and paintings by abstract artist Sally King Benedict.</p><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=880 data-injectable=true>Their house is indeed welcoming, which Hranowsky certainly vouched for, saying: “This is their year-round residence, so they wanted a home that was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">functional and inviting</a>&nbsp;but also unique.” Overall, Rucker takes excessive pride in his southern heritage and is believed to attend the University of South Carolina Gamecocks’ football games. He has also appeared in a couple of videos that provide an insight into all things best in Charleston. Today, the Grammy award winner still lives with his family in their beautiful mansion in one of South Carolina’s largest cities.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. <strong>Bill Murray</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bill-Murray.jpg><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Despite being raised in the suburbs of Chicago, the 72-year-old actor apparently fell in love with the sprawling beauty of South Carolina. In fact, if you ever choose to spend your time exploring Charleston, then stumbling on Bill Murray would not be a complete surprise. Murray now calls Charleston his home, where he is undoubtedly an active member of the Charleston community.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Interestingly, Murray has even been spotted in numerous cafes and restaurants across the city. Some of his favorite places include Husk, named the “Best New Restaurant in America” by Bon Appetite, which excels in the art of traditional southern cooking and serving. Additionally, Murray’s local coffee shop of choice is Kudu Coffee Craft Beer, while The Gin Joint rings in as his favorite cocktail bar.</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Besides his love for good coffee and food, he is also believed to have engaged in the wide restaurant business in the region. Harold’s Cabin, a fresh market Charleston café that is co-owned by him and John Schumacher, and “The Container Bar,” a food truck that he initially opened, are reflective of his interest in every little culinary detail that the region has to provide. He has also chosen O’Sullivan for his new home, which features unadulterated southern traditions as the place is a mix of beaches, local restaurants, folklore, and history.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. <strong>James Brown</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/James-Brown.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>The late American artist James Brown also lived in Beech Island, South Carolina. Born in 1933, Brown grew up in Georgia, though he also spent a large part of his life in South Carolina. According to Brown, he felt most connected to the state and believed that’s where his connection with the South was fulfilled. Even though not much is known about Brown’s South Carolina residence, the only unlikely point of connection is his accountant, Russell Bauknight.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Bauknight took over the task of managing Brown’s estate following his death in 2009 and stated that the place holds many significant portions of Brown’s life, including all the scandals involving his troubled childhood as well as alleged criminal activities and lawsuits. A substantial portion of his life was spent there, and he was later buried at the home of one of his daughters on Beech Island.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. <strong>John Mellencamp</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/John-Mellencamp.jpg><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>It was around 30 years ago when the native of Indiana discovered the Daufuskie Island, the most untouched and unspoiled beauty of South Carolina. He was so fascinated by the history of the place and the enormous privacy (as it can only be reached through a boat) that he decided to carve out a piece for himself.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>The land lay barren for almost 10 years, after which Mellencamp decided to hire an architect to build him a home. Neil Gordon designed the final product following the architectural styles and designs of the church in Myrtle Beach, which inspired him to proceed with his decision to build a house.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Monique Gibson, who worked with some of Hollywood’s powerful creative forces like Elton John, designed the interiors of the house that matched the typical Southern exuberance and warmth. The house is filled with artworks by Walt Kuhn, Marvin Cherny, and Jack Levin, along with beautiful leather upholstery and sculptural furnishings.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Mellencamp regarded South Carolina as his home and shares quite a lot of memorable experiences with his family and children, Justice and Teddi, who were raised in Hilton Head and graduated from Hilton Preparatory School. His former colleague Jeff Vrebel said in an interview, “It’s Mellencamp’s secret escape hatch. Mellencamp sees Daufuskie like Walden or the outback or the island on Lost.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stephen-colbert.jpg><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Besides his sassy and sarcastic humor, one of America’s most popular talk show hosts, Stephen Colbert, is also known for his love for the picturesque state of South Carolina. Colbert, well-known for being the host of The Colbert Report and The Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert, grew up in Charleston and graduated from Charleston Porter-Gaud School, where he participated in a number of school activities.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Not much information has been revealed about his connection with his hometown, Charleston, except that he has built his 3,040 square feet house at O’Sullivan Island, which is closer to the beach and is situated amidst the palm trees. The house is spacious, with three bathrooms and six bedrooms, which means that there are plenty of spaces for Colbert’s family and visitors. Even though his place of residence is Montclair, New Jersey, Colbert is occasionally spotted in downtown Beaufort, depicting his association with the region.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. <strong>Danny McBride</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Danny-McBride.jpg><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Actor and comedian Danny McBride, popularly known for his roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Despicable Me</a>, Eastbound & Down, and Pineapple Express, decided to relocate to South Carolina after completing two seasons of Vice Principals, which was shot in Charleston.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>He initially appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show to announce his decision to leave L.A. for Charleston. Speaking to Kimmel on the subject, he said, “I moved to Charleston two years ago. We shot Vice Principals in Charleston. We just loved it down there. We thought it was awesome.” He shared his conversation with Kanye West, too, who apparently wanted to hang out with him.</p><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=1034 data-injectable=true>McBride added, “I think he thought I lived in Los Angeles and then I was like, ‘No, I live in Charleston’ and he was quiet for a minute [then] he was like, ‘OK, I can go there too.'” Most of the cast and crew members of Vice Principals could be found in Charleston, where the whole series was shot. It was originally Bill Murray’s idea, whose utmost fascination with South Carolina led him to settle in the state and invest in its local restaurant business. It seems like McBride, not unlike many celebrities of his generation, has based his decision to move to the south on the charming allure of the region.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reese-Witherspoon.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>The Academy Award-winning actress has a special connection with her southern roots, as she decided to leave Hollywood for South Carolina following her divorce from husband Ryan Phillippe in 2008. Born in New Orleans, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legally Blonde</a> star has followed the paths of her celebrity cohorts in choosing Charleston as her safe haven at a time when she was undergoing separation from Phillippe.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=false>She was reported to be disgusted with her marriage and life in Hollywood and moved to be closer to her family. She also enrolled her children in a local public school there. At present, Witherspoon lives with her husband in their mega mansion in Brentwood, California. However, this hasn’t detached her from her southern roots, as she can occasionally be spotted shopping or eating at a local restaurant down in South Carolina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pr7EZpirnV1seqSxy56Zq6GknrK0edOhmK1lnJ7DpnnIp2Ssp6WptW6vwKumpaGelnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jami-gertz-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jami Gertz - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr;
