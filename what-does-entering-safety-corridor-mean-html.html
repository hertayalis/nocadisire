These corridors have an accident rate that is 50 percent higher than the state average, and they have had at least 1,000 crashes in a three-year period.</p><h3>What is a high-speed corridor, and how does it work?</h3><p>Known as Safety Corridors, these are specific sections of roadway that have been identified by data analysts as high-collision zones, particularly for serious injury and death accidents. These accidents are mostly caused by poor driving conduct by the drivers involved (speeding, aggressive driving, impairment and distracted driving).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the location of the acceleration lane?</h3><p>An acceleration lane is defined as a speed change area or lane that is constructed at the border of through traffic lanes to allow cars to accelerate before integrating with the through traffic flow — this is in contrast to the deceleration lane.</p><p></p><h3>What is a DUI safety corridor, and how does it work?</h3><p>A DUI traffic safety corridor is a piece of roadway or highway that has had a greater than usual number of death and injury traffic crashes involving alcohol than the general population.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In Arizona, what is the maximum speed limit on Interstate 10?</h3><p>The maximum speed limit on Interstate 10 (I-10) in Arizona is 75 miles per hour (121 kilometres per hour), with a reduction to 65 miles per hour (105 kilometres per hour) near the California border.
