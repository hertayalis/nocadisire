For the consumer and the prosumer, the biggest wins come two-fold: Intel’s 10-core processors are now set to be around $999, undercutting the previous generation by a sizable amount, but also the introduction of the new X299 chipset based motherboards that act like big PCIe switches and should offer a sizeable amount of attached functionality though additional PCIe controllers.</description></item><item><title>Nyyear Price - Age, Family, Bio</title><link>/nyyear-price-html.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/nyyear-price-html.html</guid><description>Social media personality who posts humorous relationship videos, including pranks and skits, for more than 1.1 million followers on Instagram.
