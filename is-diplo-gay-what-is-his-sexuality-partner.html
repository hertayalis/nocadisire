Net Worth Parents And Twitter</a></p><h2>Is Diplo Gay – What Is His Sexuality? Partner</h2><p>The American Dj is married to Kathryn Lockhart and Jevon King, who was the Miss Universe in 2014. The Dj has two sons with Kathryn: Lockett and Lazer, and a son Pace, with Jevon. The rapper has also dated many women, including Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A.</p><p>Furthermore, on the topic of his rumors, the Dj said in an interview on Emily Ratajkowski’s podcast that he had received a lot of oral sex from men before, but he says that does not make him gay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/318995751_1835119246851992_3172804906731879423_n.jpg><p>The public figure who has only dated women in the past says,” I don’t want to define that I’m gay, but I’m not gay, not gay. I’m not aroused by men that I know about… I’m sure I’ve gotten a blow*** from a guy before.”</p><p>Emily asks for details when he responds,” For sure, I don’t know if it’s gay unless you make eye contact while a BJ is happening.” He has also revealed that he sees himself dating a couple of men long-term.</p><p>Furthermore, there have been some rumors in 2020 about Diplo and Chantel dating, as they were seen together multiple times since, but they have never confirmed the information. In addition, the DJ kissed a Brazillian drag queen Pablo Vittar in their Entao Vai music video in 2018.</p><p>Finally, for the above reasons, his fans speculate that he is gay, but the DJ has confirmed he is not gay.

The Dj has three children: Lockett and Lazer from Kathryn and one son Pace from Jevon. The Dj has also not revealed much information about his sons.</p><p>Finally, it is very uncommon for public figures not to share information about their personal life, especially their family, for various reasons.
