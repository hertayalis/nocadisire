Raised by a single mother, Eminem faced his fair share of hardships during his early years. While he went on to achieve massive success in the music industry, his personal life stayed the same. Eminem was married to Kim Mathers, who had an upbringing similar to Eminem, if not worse. The pair married but had a rocky relationship, which led to a divorce. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Kim Mathers.</p><p><strong>Kim Mathers, also known as Kim Scott, is an American author and illustrator of children’s books. She is best known as the ex-wife of rapper Eminem.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Eminem-ex-wife-Kim-Mathers.jpg><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>Kimberly Anne Scott was born on the 9th of January, 1975, to Casimer Sluck and Kathleen Sluck. Kimberly faced abuse from a young age as her father, who was an alcoholic, would often beat her and her younger sister, Dawn. As a result, Kimberly’s parents divorced and her mother got married to another man. But to Kimberly’s dismay, her stepfather was just as worse as her father. Around the same time, Kimberly was studying at Lincoln High School alongside her sister. She met Eminem during her time in high school, who went by the name of Marshal Bruce Mathers III.</p><h2>Moving in with Eminem:</h2><p>Kim and Eminem first met in 1988 at a house party in Detroit, when Eminem was rapping LL Cool J’s I’m Bad, shitless while standing on the table. The pair got acquainted soon after and when things got bad with her stepfather, Kim and Dawn decided to move in with Eminem and his mother. Kim and Eminem graduated high school, and Kim got pregnant in 1995. She gave birth to Hailie Mathers on December 25, 1995.</p><h2>Down the rabbit hole:</h2><p>Kim Mathers and Eminem’s relationship has been a roller-coaster of love, hate, marriage, divorce, and drama. With the birth of their daughter, things started to get ugly between Eminem and Kim. The pair broke up in 1996 but reconciled in 1998. Kim and Eminem got married for the first time in 1999, the same year Eminem released his breakthrough album The Slim Shady LP. The album contained songs that depicted Kim in a negative and violent way, such as “97 Bonnie & Clyde.” &nbsp;At a later date, Kim was seen kissing the nightclub bouncer, John Guerrera. Raged by antics, Eminem attacked Gurrera and was charged with assault and possession of a concealed weapon. Eminem received probation of two years and later released his hit single, Kim.</p><h2>Suicide Attempts:</h2><p>On the 7th of July 2000, Kim and Dawn attended one of Eminem’s concerts for the Up in Smoke Tour. Before the concert, Kim mentioned that Eminem had promised her he would not play the song, Kim. But contrary to his supposed promise, Eminem played the song and even abused a blow-up doll meant to represent Kim.</p><p>Following this incident, Kim left the concert and was involved in a car accident. When she was taken back to their home in Detroit, Kim sliced her wrists in an attempt to take her own life. Following the suicide attempt, Eminem filed for Divorce and Kim sued him for defamation. However, the pair reconciled in December of 2000 and called off their divorce. The reconciliation lasted for a total of 1 year and the pair got divorced on October 11, 2001. &nbsp;They had a bitter custody battle over Hailie. Eminem continued to rap about Kim in his songs, such as “The Way I Am” and “Cleanin’ Out My Closet”.</p><h2>Second marriage with Eminem and Divorce:</h2><p>On July 8, 2001, Kim was arrested for drug abuse and driving under influence. In 2002, Kim gave birth to Whitney with Eric Hartter. Kim and Eminem got back together in 2004 and decided to re-marry in 2005. The couple said their vows on January 14, 2006, but filed for divorce on April 6, 2006.</p><p>Following the divorce, Kim and Eminem decided to share the custody of Hailie. On the other hand, Eminem was awarded full custody of Whitney and Alaina. Alaina is the daughter of Dawn, who passed away on January 19, 2016, due to a Heroin overdose.</p><p>Kim and Eminem have not been romantically involved since their second divorce.
