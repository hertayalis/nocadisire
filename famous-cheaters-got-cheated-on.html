Talk about karma.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I'm not sure if I believe in karma, but if it exists, these celebrities have definitely felt its wrath. Although famous cheaters are literally a dime a dozen in Hollywood, their infidelities still make them enemy No. 1 in the eyes of the public. No matter how many stars pine about how "the heart wants what it wants," at the end of the day, their love stories left many emotional casualties behind, which is hard to ignore.</p><p>But not all cheaters get to ride happily into the sunset. Many famous adulterers find themselves on the opposite site of the equation when they later get cheated on. Ah, sweet, sweet karma. Below, a few celebrity cheaters who got their just desserts.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Kardashian cheated on her first husband.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Before Kris Humphries and Kanye West, Kim was married to record producer Damon Thomas, but things obviously didn't end well. Fifteen years later and he's still harboring a grudge, running off to the tabloids last year to reveal that Kim cheated on him with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"multiple guys"</a> throughout their three-year marriage.</p><p>The guy she dated next, Ray J, who's known for starring alongside her in the their infamous sex tape, later corroborated Damon's story in a tell-all book. "[KK] let me know she wanted to get with me," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "She left her husband for me as soon as we started having sex.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ray J then cheated on her.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In the same tell-all book, Ray J admitted that he cheated on Kim on her birthday, which he admitted was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"sinking low."</a> Kim later confirmed on the story on Jimmy Kimmel Live, but she didn't mention Ray J's name.</p><p>"I got into the voicemail thing and it was on my birthday," she revealed. "I was at dinner with all of my best friends [and] put it on speaker ... wondering where my boyfriend was. His voicemail ... he was flying in town to meet another girl on my birthday and lied to me that he was in another city."</p><p>Damon probably cackled in revenge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Britney Spears allegedly cheated on Justin Timberlake.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>You all know the story. Back when they were teenybopper royalty, they had a messy split, with Justin not-so subtlety hinting that Britney cheated on him in his "Cry Me a River" video. Britney never confirmed or denied it, but most people accepted it as fact. Even in the Lifetime biopic, Britney Ever After, it was hinted that Britney cheated on Justin with dancer Wade Robson.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twelve years later, she's cheated on by David Lucado.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2014, Britney got refreshingly candid during a concert about her ex cheating on her. Her then-boyfriend, David, was caught on camera swapping spit with another woman mere days before the concert.</p><p>"Well, by now everyone knows my boyfriend cheated on me," she said during her Las Vegas residency. "The best thing about your boyfriend cheating on you is that you get to go on another first date!"&nbsp;</p><p>One of those first dates was with Sam Asghari, and they're still dating today.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jude Law cheated on Sienna Miller with his nanny.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Back in 2006, Jude kicked off the whole "cheating with the nanny" trend during his much publicized affair with Daisy Wright. "That was a very pivotal time in my life, and I’m happy saying that,” Sienna told Vogue in 2009 after things blew over. “It’s a private moment when you get your heart broken for the first time.” Fortunately for her, she would get the last laugh.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sienna then cheated on him with Daniel Craig.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Despite the infidelity, Jude and Sienna stayed together until 2011 (with many separations in between). During one of those many respites, Sienna had a brief fling with Daniel. They were outed by Daniel's driver, who sold the story to News of the World. When Jude found out about it, he had his lawyers contact the paper and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">try to backdate the story</a> so that it could appear like she cheated on him first. Needless to say, it didn't work.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rob Kardashian cheated on Adrienne Bailon.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although it was one of Rob's first public romances, it turned into one of the messiest when news got out that he had cheated on her. To make things more awkward, the whole thing played out for the world to see on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think anyone who has been in a relationship where they've been cheated on or hurt, it affects you," Adrienne later said on The Real. "It affected me so much that I made it a conscious decision not to do that to the next person, because when you experience the kind of hurt that being cheated on will make you question yourself. "</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rob was later cheated on by Blac Chyna.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Rob met his messier half when he hooked up with Blac Chyna. As if their many shouting matches on Rob & Chyna weren't enough evidence that trouble was afoot, things really blew up when Rob discovered Blac was cheating on him with singer Pilot Jones. Sucks being the victim now, huh Rob?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennifer Lopez allegedly cheated on Cris Judd.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After the failure of her second marriage, J.Lo rebounded quickly, running around town with Ben Affleck before the ink on the divorce papers was dry. While angry fans nicknamed her "J.Ho," Cris' father ran to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Enquirer</a> to confirm that Jennifer had cheated on his son. However, to this day, Jennifer denies she cheated. "I wasn't raised that way," she told Wendy Williams back when the scandal first started. "I honor loyalty." However, the sketchy timeline of her relationship does make you think.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Years later, she was cheated on by Casper Smart.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After the demise of Bennifer and her third marriage to Marc Anthony, Jennifer began dating another attractive backup dancer. But things didn't end well when it was revealed that he had cheated on her numerous times. "She kicked him out because he cheated on her and he got caught," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People.</a> “It happened two years ago, and he promised he would never do it again and once he did, she was done.”</p><p>Today, she's dating serial-cheater Alex Rodriguez. Surely nothing bad could possibly happen to that relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessica Simpson allegedly cheated on Nick Lachey.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although they were reality-TV royalty thanks to their hit MTV show, their relationship was full of cracks viewers didn't see. After their split, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there were rumors </a>that Jessica cheated on Nick with her Dukes of Hazzard co-star Johnny Knoxville, and even Adam Levine. However, in 2006, Jackass' Bam Margera <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that he slept with Jessica in 2005, while Nick "was away."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eric Johnson allegedly cheated on her.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After a revolving door of musician boyfriends, from Billy Corgan to John Mayer, Jessica finally settled down with Eric in 2010. However, just two years later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports alleged </a>that he was cheating on her with his ex-wife. Considering they had just had their first child together, it's easy to surmise that they decided to work things out. Today, they're still together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Duchovny cheated on Téa Leoni numerous times.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Back in 2008, The X-Files star checked into rehab for sex addition after cheating on his wife a gazillion times. Téa must have the patience of a saint because she endured it for 11 years. Fortunately, she later got her revenge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Téa cheated on David with Billy Bob Thornton. &nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After David's bout in rehab, Téa decided to get close to her Manure&nbsp;co-star, Billy Bob Thornton. You would think David would be more forgiving due to the numerous times he cheated on her, but nope. After he found dirty texts on her phone, he demanded a separation.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paris Hilton allegedly cheated on Nick Carter.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2006, Nick called into Ryan Seacrest's radio show to drop a bombshell. He revealed that Paris, who he dated from 2003 to 2004, cheated on him with her House of Wax co-star, Chad Michael Murray. "Paris was the worst person in the world for me to hook up with," he would later write in his memoir.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He then cheated on her with Ashlee Simpson.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As revenge, Nick decided to act on impulses he already had around the pop singer. "I'd fallen head over heels with [Ashlee]," he said in 2006. "Then, all of a sudden, three months go by and I got people telling me, 'Nick, you know what Paris is doing to you,' and I got a little upset. So then I just decided to fight back a little bit and started doing my own thing again."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tori Spelling cheated on her first husband.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Tori's first husband, Charlie Shanian, was more than a little peeved when he discovered his wife was cheating on him with Dean McDermott<strong> </strong>via a tabloid he saw at a supermarket. "(Tori) was not happy when she was alone with me," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> in 2007. "She’d only married me because I loved her and took care of her; she had purposefully shown me only 10 percent of her true personality; and, oh yeah, while in Canada, she’d cheated on me with her latest Lifetime-movie costar."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dean McDermott later cheated on her.</h2><p>Despite their cheating ways,&nbsp;the couple happily remained together for years and even appeared in a reality TV show together. However, in 2013, a woman stepped forward and revealed that she was having an affair with Dean. "He told me he and Tori had a sexless marriage," the woman, Emily Goodhand, told Us Weekly. "I believed him."&nbsp;</p><p>Dean then confessed to the cheating on the couple's reality show, True Tori. "I feel shame. I’ve never felt shame before,” he said of his transgressions. “You were at a Christmas event, and I was f––king around. That’s disgusting. That’s disgusting."</p><p>Tori was crushed, but hey, it's like what they say —&nbsp;what goes around comes around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpcF9lf3B%2BkYCjpIdfm66uu9SsZJyglZbBpr7SZp6orF2Ytaat056bZqee</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cal-worthington-net-worth-277801.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cal Worthington Net Worth 2024">&larr;
